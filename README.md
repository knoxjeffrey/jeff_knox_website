## Static site build with components - attempt 2

Eleventy static site with Preact. Bundle size too large already with just 1 library added. Tried switching to rollup which reduces the bundle much better but now the hooks in Preact break. Waaaaaayyyyy too long on config. Back to reseaching better ways of doing this.
